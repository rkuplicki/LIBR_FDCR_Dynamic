masks-FDCR+tlrc contains the ROI masks used in:
Ekhtiari, H., Kuplicki, R., Aupperle, R. L., & Paulus, M. P. (2021). It is Never as Good the Second Time Around: Brain Areas Involved in Salience Processing Habituate During Repeated Drug Cue Exposure in Treatment Engaged Abstinent Methamphetamine and Opioid Users. NeuroImage, 118180.


all ROIs were extracted from the meth dataset dataset (n~60) after running the LME 'beta ~ condition * time' where condition is drug or neutral and time is 1,2,3,4.
these were extracted based on the f-stat of the condition*time interaction as described below
1: VMPFC extracted at p < 0.001
3: LSTG extracted at p < 0.001
4: RSTG extracted at p < 0.001
5: L Ventral Striatum extracted at p < 0.05 intersected with brainnetome ROIs 219 and 223
6: R Ventral Striatum extracted at p < 0.05 intersected with brainnetome ROIs 220 and 224
8: R Amygdala extracted at p < 0.05 intersected with brainnetome ROIs 212 and 214
these were extracted based on the f-stat of condition as described below
9: LIFG extracted at p < 0.001
10: RIFG at p < 0.001
12: RDLPFC at p < 0.001
